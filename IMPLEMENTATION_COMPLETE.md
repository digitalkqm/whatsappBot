# ✅ Implementation Complete - Valuation Workflow with Supabase

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend - Workflow Handlers ✅

**`/workflows/valuationRequestSupabase.js`**
- Detects "Valuation Request:" template in WhatsApp groups
- Parses 6 fields: Address, Size, Asking, Salesperson, Agent Number, Banker Name
- Auto-formats agent number (adds country code 65 if missing)
- Routes to banker based on "Banker Name" keyword matching
- Saves complete request to Supabase
- Forwards ONLY 3 fields (Address, Size, Asking) to banker's WhatsApp group
- Sends acknowledgment to requester group
- Tracks all message IDs for two-way linking

**`/workflows/valuationReplySupabase.js`**
- Detects when banker replies (quoted message in banker's group)
- Looks up original request via `forward_message_id`
- Formats reply with banker's bank name in header
- **Dual Forwarding**:
  - To **Requester Group**: `From Banker: [Bank] - [Name]\n\nAddress:\nSize:\nAsking:\nValuation: [reply]`
  - To **Agent Private Chat**: `Address:\nSize:\nAsking:\nValuation: [reply]` (clean format, no header)
- Updates database with completion tracking

### 2. Backend - Message Handler Updates ✅

**Updated `/index.js`**:
- Added detection for valuation request template (`Valuation Request:`)
- Added detection for banker replies (quoted messages in banker groups)
- Routes to appropriate workflow:
  - `valuation_request` → `valuationRequestWorkflow()`
  - `valuation_reply` → `valuationReplyWorkflow()`
- Maintains compatibility with old valuation workflow

### 3. Backend - API Endpoints ✅

**`/api/valuationAPI.js`** - CRUD for valuation requests:
- `GET /api/valuations/list` - List with filters (status, banker, date, search)
- `GET /api/valuations/:id` - Get single valuation
- `PUT /api/valuations/:id/update` - Update valuation
- `DELETE /api/valuations/:id/delete` - Delete valuation

## Database Schema Required

**Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- File: /database/supabase_schema_update.sql
```

This creates:
1. **`bankers` table** (14 pre-seeded bankers with actual WhatsApp group IDs)
2. **`banker_routing_rules` table** (optional routing configuration)
3. **Updates to `valuation_requests` table** (adds 20+ new columns for tracking)
4. **Views**: `vw_recent_valuations`, `vw_banker_performance`
5. **Functions**: `route_to_banker()`, `increment_banker_valuation_count()`

---

## Complete Two-Way Flow

### Stage 1: Request Received
**User sends** in "Keyquest Mortgage Team" group:
```
Valuation Request:

Address: Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4
Size: 1200 sqft
Asking: $500,000
Salesperson Name: John Tan
Agent Number: 91234567
Banker Name: Yvonne
```

**System**:
1. Detects template format
2. Parses 6 fields, auto-formats agent number → `6591234567`
3. Routes to Yvonne (matches keyword "yvonne")
4. Saves to database with all tracking fields

### Stage 2: Forward to Banker
**System sends to Yvonne's WhatsApp group** (`6596440186-1598498077@g.us`):
```
Valuation Request:

Address: Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4
Size: 1200 sqft
Asking: $500,000
```

**Stores `forward_message_id`** = critical for linking!

### Stage 3: Acknowledge to Requester
**System sends back to "Keyquest Mortgage Team"**:
```
Thanks! We've forwarded your request to Yvonne.
We'll let you know when they replied.
```

### Stage 4: Banker Replies
**Yvonne replies** (quotes the forwarded message):
```
Based on recent transactions, estimated valuation is $480,000 to $520,000.
Property is well-maintained. Good buying opportunity.
Contact me for viewing arrangement.
- Yvonne (AG001)
```

**System**:
1. Detects reply (has quoted message)
2. Looks up via `forward_message_id`
3. Retrieves original request details

### Stage 5: Dual Forwarding
**A) To Requester Group** ("Keyquest Mortgage Team"):
```
From Banker: Premas - Yvonne

Address: Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4
Size: 1200 sqft
Asking: $500,000
Valuation: Based on recent transactions, estimated valuation is $480,000 to $520,000. Property is well-maintained. Good buying opportunity. Contact me for viewing arrangement. - Yvonne (AG001)
```

**B) To Agent Private Chat** (`6591234567@c.us`):
```
Address: Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4
Size: 1200 sqft
Asking: $500,000
Valuation: Based on recent transactions, estimated valuation is $480,000 to $520,000. Property is well-maintained. Good buying opportunity. Contact me for viewing arrangement. - Yvonne (AG001)
```

**Database updated**: `status = 'completed'`, all tracking fields filled

## How to Test

### 1. Run Database Schema
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy contents of /database/supabase_schema_update.sql
# Execute all SQL
```

### 2. Start Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Navigate to UI
```
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:3000/valuations.html
http://localhost:3000/bankers.html
```

### 4. Send Test Request
In WhatsApp group, send:
```
Valuation Request:

Address: Test Property
Size: 1000 sqft
Asking: $400,000
Salesperson Name: Test User
Agent Number: 91234567
Banker Name: Yvonne
```

### 5. Check Database
```sql
SELECT * FROM valuation_requests ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### 6. Reply as Banker
In Yvonne's group, **reply** (quote) the forwarded message:
```
Estimated valuation: $380,000 to $420,000
```

### 7. Verify Dual Forwarding
- Check requester group for reply with "From Banker" header
- Check agent's private chat (`6591234567@c.us`) for clean formatted reply
